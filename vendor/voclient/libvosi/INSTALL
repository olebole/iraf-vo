		 ===========================================
		    LIBVOSI v1.0 Installation Instructions
		 ===========================================


	LIBVOSI is distributed as a GZip compressed tarball of either 
the source, or pre-built binaries for a particular platform.  Current dist-
ributions include:

    libvosi-src.tar.gz	    	Source code distribution 
    libvosi-linux.tar.gz	Linux binary distribution
    libvosi-osx.tar.gz	    	Mac OSX (Universal Binary) distribution


See the README file for a complete list of the contents in the source
distribution.  Binary distributions will contain the following files
and directories:

    INSTALL		This file
    libvosi.a		The VOSI library 

Software wishing to use the language binding wrappers should build from
source.


Requirements Checklist:

    o   The parser library is entirely self-contained, there are no known 
	external requirements.


=======================
To Install from Source:
=======================


1)  Create a directory for the source, and unpack the distirbution tar file:

	% mkdir /path/libvosi		    	# create directory
	% cd /path/libvosi			# go there
	% tar zxf /path/libvosi-src.tar.gz	# unpack the distrbution

2)  Compile the package:

	% make					# Do the compilation

3)  To install, copy the library to a system or project directory.  In some
    cases this will require root permission in order to do it.  Assuming you
    want to install in /usr/local/bin, something like the following 
    command:

	% su					# become 'root'
	# cp -p libvosi.a /usr/local/lib 	# copy binaries


======================================
To Install from a Binary Distribution:
======================================

1)  Create a temporary directory to unpack the files:

	% mkdir /tmp/libvosi			# create temp directory
	% cd /tmp/libvosi			# go there
	% tar zxf /path/libvosi-<arch>.tar.gz   # unpack the distrbution

2)  To install, copy the library to a system or project directory.  In some
    cases this will require root permission in order to do it.  Assuming you
    want to install in /usr/local/bin, something like the following 
    command:

	% su					# become 'root'
	# cp -p libvosi.a /usr/local/lib 	# copy binaries
